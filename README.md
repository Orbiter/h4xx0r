# h4xx0r
h4xx0r.org home page

This is an experimental web page to practice things which serious open source/free software developers should not do, like

- user tracking (we might do that here just to show how evil it is)
- allowing XSS to happen
- cross-domain API retrieval
- bad cookie usage
- exposing information about visitors (like browser/os details and IP numbers) to other people, in the public

In fact, almost all the web pages are using such data, store it, sell it etc.
This page is a laboratory to do experiments with such techniques and to exose the results to the public.

To sum up: evil things may happen if you visit this page. Take care!
